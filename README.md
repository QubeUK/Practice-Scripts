# Random Learning & Practice Files

**`QubeUK (IT Professional)`**

This repo is used as a staging area for learning and development projects before they get promoted into their own dedicated repos. 

This repo also acts as a graveyard ðŸ’€ for projects that never progressed any further, as a resting place for their remains and where their bones can be picked over for any scraps that may be of use elsewhere in the future.
